HIGH
saving wallet after make_multisig() causess refresh thread exception
open monero core issues
optimize multisig tests: profile diff with startSyncing() running
optimize multisig tests: jni can keep references of open jni wallets so wallets are not closed and re-opened
test multisig with transfer and other sends
add getIncomingTransfers(), getOutgoingTransfers() convenience methods
add testSweepUnlocked() which targets accounts and subaddresses
support close(bool save)
add output min, max, height to output query, transfer query
support sign_transfer, submit_transfer
test tx set in cold wallet with sign and submit
test tx set in regular wallet (null values + txs)
add any open init steps from make_from_json?
test sending without enough money, should be consistent across calls
update model: multisig methods and models, sample code rescan_spent(), MoneroTxSet attribute of MoneroTxWallet, sweepAllUnlocked()->sweepUnlocked()
daemon.getNextBlockHeader() sometimes hangs
wallet rpc get_balance res.multisig_import_needed = m_wallet->multisig() && m_wallet->has_multisig_partial_key_images();
new MoneroWalletJni(new MoneroWalletConfig().setMnemonic("hello").setRestoreHeight(1234).setPath("/asdfasdfasdfafd").setPassword("....").setDaemonUri(new MoneroDaemonUri()), etc
tx.getNumConfirmations() should be initialized whenever tx.getHeight() is
fix qr
rpc wallet listener
approximate chain height
rpc on_generate_from_keys
update javascript library to Java (difference from Java master to jni93 branch)
re-enable sample code build
release
open issue: investigate integration of this library into Bisq

MEDIUM
update send end height mid sync so 100% figure is accurate
tx pool stats and other binary calls
performance tests (memory leaks, concurrent wallets, etc)
sync progress can made more accurate by basing on output distribution
test force split transactions
if txs are split or only specific vouts/outputs are requested, tx amounts, isIncoming, etc will be incomplete and not based on all sub-transfers.  Issue at all?
auto-select account index for send request if not given?
support rpc wallet sync(listener)
remove createAccount() and addAccount(), manage automatically as sparse matrix?
rpc sweepAllUnlocked() modifies original send request
test changing wallet password with moveTo()
preserve original send request instead of modifying it?  implement copy constructor
getAddressIndex() -> getSubaddress(String address) and that returns full subaddress info?
wallet.getIsSynced() should return false after block added to chain if not auto syncing
full ux test among multiple wallets
support args rescanBlockchain(bool hard, bool refresh, bool keep_key_images)
test pruning?
local vs remote requests per second auto-adjusts like gui wallet.cpp:2204
define specification for rct_signatures, rct_prunable, multisig_txset, unsigned_tx_set
retrival by ranges end height should be exclusive? would be inconsistent with current rpc api
random wallet should be synced if created with rpc connection?
introduce query object for accounts? includeSubaddresses
MoneroTransfer accountIdx, subaddressIdx could be int.  only query needs to support null.  same with other models
testSendWithPaymentId() test that unconfirmed tx is immediately returned from getTxs() with payment id filter
test out of range subaddress access for offline access
architecture diagram

LOW
switch jni bridge json serialization to automated construction of native types for performance
wallet.getLanguage() api even if rpc doesn't support?
testGetNewKeyImagesFromLastImport
connect to peers
support syncAsync() - immediate asynchronous invocation
rescanAsync()
waitForTxsToClear() should refresh more frequently than blocks so it continues if pool manually flushed
tests cap creation of accounts by ignoring test if more than X accounts already exist
tx in pool can reconcile to failed
add warnings to all deserialization methods for unrecognized fields
test wallet gets should send test transaction so unconfirmed tx can be tested with the others
test querying with not relayed
scan code for issues using automated tool
rename getLanguages() to getSupportedLanguages()?

--------- MONERO CORE ISSUES ---------

OPEN ISSUES
User experience: 5 - 1 = 4 but wallet2 reports the incorrect balance until the first confirmation: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/5809
User experience: let users spend low confirmation funds without being locked for 10 blocks: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/5810
wallet2 does not fully sync transactions in the pool: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/5811
wallet2 import_key_images erases incoming transfers: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/5812
wallet2 does not report incoming transfers with outgoing counterpart from same account (older): https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/4500

ISSUES TO OPEN
wallet2 refactor
generalize multisig wallet creation to 1) prepare, 2) make, 3) for M-N times.  This issue proposes deprecating finalize_multisig and replacing it with exchange_multisig_keys
wallet rpc on_transfer_split should throw if no txs are created, same as how transfer throws if exactly one tx is not created

MEDIUM / OUTDATED?
test rapid send through a wallet
incoming outputs do not appear until first confirmation, sub-issue?
getReserveProofAccount() seg faulting (with no unlocked balance / spending 0-conf???), wallet rpc get_reserve_proof
save network type with wallet export/import
getTxPool() occasionally hangs (have no peer connections?)
rpc testCreateWalletFromMnemonic() sometimes wallet is synced after fresh creation when run with other tests
Mining to subaddress isn't supported yet
failed tx in pool (after testUpdateLockedDifferentAccounts()) causes non-originating saved wallets to return duplicate incoming transfers but one has amount/numSuggestedConfirmations of 0, possibly no outgoingTransfer
peer.getLastSeenTimestamp() occasionally returns -4
wallet2 get_payments() min_height is exclusive and max_height is inclusive: #5598, #5751
wallet.cpp:2093 doRefresh() calls find_and_save_rings but wallet rpc run() does not?
start height processed > requested start height unless restore height manually set
my daemon on stagenet says `Sync data returned a new top block candidate: 365062 -> 365545`.  if I mine, the daemon seems to mine on 365062.  if I create a new wallet, its restore height is set to 365545, but daemon `get_height` reports 365062
don't require writing to disk to make working wallet
add all_accounts to incoming_transfers, would be huge time saver
sometimes see non-zero spent amount in testCheckReserve()
one time: testCheckTxKey() -24: No tx secret key is stored for this tx, RPC request: 'get_tx_key' with params: {"txid":"e779dbb7fbff77544ea39de062b12c1d722901ed937a833307c1b5b3cea41069"}
Marking output 18666(<9cd46fd977f2d8f6112cc87592677cbd76801b318c6e607dd31b9a25dd7d9530>) as unspent, it was marked as spent
cannot send: -4: Known ring does not include the spent output: 1255232 (this fixed itself, not sure how)
file issue to get received timestamp for unconfirmed wallet txs if wanted
No message store file found: /Applications/190322-monero-master//test_wallet_1.mms
WARNING: key proof indicates no funds received despite transfer (txid=76983ebf1d2e62141c19e190355e146145cb03988c5bfaf857b65dc0e15d378f, key=5246bf34d97dd379843ea31cb2bddfe41a89db73be4bd72fdc1ffe1b4d8ac70d, address=76gP3JEGAhnS5sgnB7LHRP2tbidL8ChvkJATJADQF4SpBcbN8bUgSZyQmTpdMQqyW129dh3zV5XscaBhkU6WTUKQVdDykFV, amount=44933)
cannot save after creating wallet2 because store()/store_to() does not generate cache file when initially generated with empty strings
store() does nothing if no name previously set, throw exception instead?
store_to() is actually move(), deleting old files if they exist.  support "save as"
new wallet() without connection but restoreHeight is checkpointed; where is that data cached?
wallet_rpc_server.cpp:404: entry.address = m_wallet->get_subaddress_as_str({pd.m_subaddr_account, 0}) will always use subaddress idx 0, ignoring all actual subaddress indices
suggested_confirmations_threshold comes back as 0 for some (not all) outgoing transfers, but always >0 for incoming transfers, even if theyâ€™re transfers to/from the same wallet.  Can a value of 0 make sense?
document query_key spend_key parameter
wallet2->get_payments() does not return transfers in order of height, probably others
no way to get order of block txs from wallet2
typos on monero-wallet-rpc tx proofs, wrong output on check_reserve_proof
get_transfer add tx_size, tx_key (out or pending), destinations (pending), key_image (in or mempool)
get_transfers should default to all subaddresses, else all subaddresses must be pre-fetched to get all txs in account
get_transfer_by_txid add tx_size
incoming_transfers add address (low priority), fee, timestamp, unlock_time, is_double_spend, height, tx_size (misdocumented)
get transactions per block
lots of internal wallet errors when daemon rpc tests run
add final keyword to method args where appropriate
update send end height mid sync so 100% figure is accurate
failure in sync test does not propagate back through c++ and back to Java to indicate test failure
wallet2 sweep_all if subaddress_indices are not specified it chooses random subaddress, 0 last in create_transactions_all()

LOW
unlockTime should probably be long / uint64_t
on_money_spent() tx in vs out are same tx always
on_money_spent() / on_money_received() do not provide output index
common wallet tests test structures of txs, transfers, and outputs in testGetTxs(), etc
should vouts be part of incoming transfers?  typically one vout per transfer but not necessarily?
wallet.cpp m_synchronized only ever set to true, never false
get_reserve_proof document default account 0
check_reserve_proof documentation spent and total not documented as outputs
-1: Failed to open wallet if wallet is already open; better code and message
don't return incorrect balance information if multisig, instead return error
get_transfers defaults [0, 0], incoming_transfers defaults [0, all], get_bulk_payments defaults [all, all] (especially get_transfers should default to all else call to get_address is required first)
get_transfers returns all transactions whereas incoming_transfers returns incoming outputs; clarify terminology or both could return transactions for consistency
document get_transfers account_index and subaddr_indices defaults
document that rescan_bc destroys wallet cache (destination addresses, etc)
height vs block_height inconsistent
address book entries work by index instead of id which changes
tx_hash in incoming_transfers vs txid in get_transfers; standardize on tx_hash or tx_id
standardize terminology transactions vs transfers
standardize terminology payment vs output; one payment may be fulfilled with multiple outputs
